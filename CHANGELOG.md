# CHANGELOG — CID Portal → Production Platform

## Phase 1 — Backend foundation (this change)
Goal: stand up the Supabase backend that every module will migrate onto, with
real RBAC. No working front-end logic was rewritten in this phase.

### Added
- `supabase/migrations/20260616090000_platform.sql` — full platform schema:
  - **27 tables**: profiles, cases, case_assignments, persons, evidence,
    custody_chain (append-only), gangs, gang_ranks, gang_members, places,
    place_process_steps, narcotics, narcotic_precursors, narcotic_hotspots,
    ballistics_benches, ballistic_footprints, reports (with finalize +
    e-signature columns), trackers, rico_cases, predicate_acts, media,
    documents (server-side CID General docs), tickets, raid_compensations,
    mo_profiles, notifications, audit_log.
  - **Relational spine**: evidence/media/reports/trackers/hotspots/footprints/
    predicate_acts/gang_members all carry a `case_id` FK; predicate_acts link to
    `evidence`; gang_members link to `persons` + `cases`.
  - **RBAC RLS** (verified against Supabase docs):
    - `private` schema security-definer helpers (`is_active`, `role`,
      `can_delete`, `is_command`) with `search_path=''`.
    - Read = **approved members only** (inactive sign-ins see nothing).
    - Create/update = any active member; **delete = Director + Command**.
    - `profiles`: self-view + self-edit, with a guard trigger blocking
      role/active/division self-escalation; Command-only `assign_member` RPC.
    - Append-only `custody_chain` + `audit_log` (insert/select only).
    - Per-user `notifications`.
  - **Triggers**: `updated_at` touch on 18 tables; generic **audit** trigger on
    16 tables → `audit_log`; `handle_new_user` creates an inactive profile on
    OAuth signup; `bootstrap_command(email)` to seat the first admin.
  - **Realtime** publication on all 27 tables.
- `SETUP.md` — full deploy + Google/Discord OAuth + migration + bootstrap + RBAC.

### Verified
- Migration applies cleanly on Postgres 17 (27 tables, 102 policies, 27 realtime,
  16 audit triggers).
- RBAC behavior tested as the `authenticated` role: inactive → 0 reads;
  activated detective → create+read; detective delete → 0 rows (denied);
  Director delete → success; audit_log captured insert+delete.

### Fixed (bugs caught while building)
- `default (select auth.uid())` → `default auth.uid()` (subqueries are not
  allowed in column DEFAULTs; the `(select …)` form is only for RLS perf).
- `private` schema was revoked from `authenticated`, which would break every RLS
  policy (policy expressions run as the caller); now grants USAGE + EXECUTE on
  the helpers to `authenticated`.

## Pending phases (not in this change)
- **Phase 2 — Front-end:** multi-file split (`index.html` + `styles` + feature
  JS modules + `supabase.js`/`auth.js`); **login gate** (Google + Discord),
  logged-out users see only the login screen; migrate every module's data layer
  from `localStorage` to Supabase with realtime; first-class **Evidence** module
  + **Case Detail** view (Overview/Evidence/Reports/Media/Suspects/Gangs/RICO/
    Timeline/Trackers/Chain-of-Custody) + auto timeline; **RBAC-aware** edit
  affordances; **remove all seed data** → empty states + CSV/JSON import;
  notifications panel; analytics from `audit_log`; PDF export; full case-packet
  export. Blocked on: Google + Discord OAuth credentials + authorization to
  resume/apply against the live project.

### Data migration note (localStorage → Supabase)
The current single-file app stores everything under `localStorage` key
`cid-portal-v3` (cases, gangs, places, reports, rico, trackers, media, cidDocs,
caseCounters). Phase 2 ships a one-time importer to load any existing browser
data into the new tables via the UI; nothing is baked into source.

## Phase 2 — Front-end foundation (this change)
Target project corrected to **`cid`** (`jhxuflzmqspidkvjckox`, active); `sahp-rbac` was the wrong project.

### Added / changed
- **Multi-file split** (no build step, still a static SPA):
  - `index.html` — markup only.
  - `styles.css` — the precompiled Tailwind + custom CSS (was inlined) + gate CSS.
  - `app.js` — the existing application logic, moved verbatim (not rewritten).
  - `supabase.js` — Supabase client + thin data layer (`window.CIDDB`): auth
    helpers + generic list/insert/update/remove/subscribe. Guarded if unconfigured.
  - `auth.js` — **login gate**: logged-out users see only the login screen
    (Google + Discord OAuth + email magic link); signed-in-but-unapproved users
    see a pending-approval screen; approved (active profile) users get the app +
    an identity/sign-out chip in the top bar. Drives `body[data-auth]`.
- Front-end config wired to the real `cid` project URL + publishable key.

### Verified (jsdom, offline)
Split loads; gate shows by default with the graceful offline notice; app shell
hidden when logged out; `app.js` still initializes; records nav intact.

### Still pending in Phase 2 (blocked / next)
- **Schema reconciliation**: the `cid` project already has `cid_records` (2 rows)
  + `case_files` (0 rows), which diverge from the Phase-1 platform schema
  (`cases`, `evidence`, …). Need a decision before applying the platform
  migration / migrating module data layers.
- Apply the platform migration (creates `profiles` — required for auth approval
  to actually work) once schema is reconciled.
- Configure Google + Discord providers in the dashboard to test real sign-in.
- Then: per-module localStorage→Supabase data layer, Case Detail + Evidence UI,
  RBAC-aware edit affordances, notifications, analytics, PDF, seed removal.

### Applied to the live `cid` project (this turn)
- Applied `20260616090000_platform.sql` to project `cid` (jhxuflzmqspidkvjckox):
  27 platform tables created with RLS, alongside the pre-existing `cid_records`
  (2 rows) + `case_files` — no collisions, no data loss.
- Ran the Supabase **security advisor**; fixed a real finding: `bootstrap_command`
  (SECURITY DEFINER, no internal guard) was REST-callable by anon/authenticated —
  a self-promotion-to-Command hole. Revoked execute from anon/authenticated/public
  (SQL-editor only). Trimmed `assign_member` from anon (still callable by
  authenticated Command users; internally guarded).
- Remaining advisor notes (not addressed here): `case_files.cf_delete USING(true)`
  is a pre-existing user table (left untouched); leaked-password protection is an
  auth setting irrelevant to our OAuth + magic-link flow.

### To make auth functional (your dashboard steps)
1. Authentication → Providers: enable **Google** + **Discord** (creds + the
   `https://jhxuflzmqspidkvjckox.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` redirect).
2. Authentication → URL Configuration: set Site URL + Redirect URLs to your Pages URL.
3. Sign in once, then SQL editor: `select public.bootstrap_command('<your-login-email>');`

## Phase 2 — Module migration #1: Case Files (this change)
First module migrated off localStorage onto the live Supabase schema (project `cid`).

### Added
- **Case Files tab** (sidebar + mobile bar) — Supabase-backed, RBAC-aware, realtime.
  - List of cases (cards) from `public.cases`, filter + refresh, empty/“create first” states.
  - Create/Edit case modal (case_number/title/bureau/status/summary) → `CIDDB` insert/update.
  - **Case Detail** view with tabs: Overview, Evidence, Reports, Timeline.
  - **Evidence** module: add evidence per case; **chain-of-custody** append-only transfer log.
  - **Timeline**: merges case-open + evidence collection + report + custody-transfer events.
  - RBAC affordances: create/edit shown to active members (`CIDDB.canEdit`); **delete** only
    for Director/Command (`CIDDB.canDelete`); realtime re-fetch via `CIDDB.subscribe('cases')`.
- `supabase.js`: added `me`/`role()`/`canEdit()`/`canDelete()`; `auth.js` caches the
  profile + calls `CIDApp.onAuthed()` so modules load once a session is approved.

### Verified
- All JS passes `node --check`; jsdom load is clean (no window errors; gate works; Cases
  tab shows its sign-in notice offline).
- **Live schema round-trip via MCP** on project `cid`: inserted case→evidence→custody,
  confirmed FK cascade on delete and that audit triggers fired (audit_log += 3); test rows
  removed (0 leftover).
- Hardened: guarded `history.replaceState` so restricted/file:// contexts can't break routing.

### Next modules (same pattern)
persons/suspects, gangs (+members→persons), places, narcotics/ballistics hotspot+footprint
links, reports (finalize + e-sign + PDF), trackers (server-side + notify), RICO (pull
predicates from evidence), audit-log feed + analytics on Central Command, seed removal +
CSV/JSON import, full case-packet export.

## Phase 2 — Module migration #2: Persons + Gangs (this change)
- Added `gang_turf` table + free-text `gang_members.rank` (migration
  `20260616093000_gang_turf_member_rank.sql`; applied to project `cid`).
- **Persons** (new tab, Supabase): suspects/POI CRUD with gang link, CCW/VCH/
  felony fields (≥8 flag), mugshot, notes; filter + realtime; delete gated to
  Director/Command.
- **Gangs** migrated OFF localStorage onto Supabase: list + record CRUD, and a
  **Gang Detail** with rank-grouped **member** sub-CRUD (members link to a
  Person and a Case), **turf** sub-CRUD, and read-only **linked properties**
  (places whose controlling_gang = this gang). `GANGS` is now a Supabase read
  cache feeding the place/media/RICO gang pickers.
- Fixed RICO references that used the old localStorage gang shape
  (`.members`/`.threat`) → now use `threat_level`.
- Verified: node --check; clean jsdom load (both tabs, proper sign-in notices,
  no errors); live MCP round-trip on `cid` (gang→person→member(person+case)→turf
  insert with full FK chain; cascade-clean delete).

## Phase 2 — Module migration #3: Narcotics (this change)
- **Narcotics** migrated off localStorage onto Supabase (narcotics + precursors +
  hotspots). `DRUGS` is now a normalized read cache; the expandable registry,
  purity-slider→adjusted-value calc, pricing/popularity bars and case-linked
  hotspots are preserved (logic unchanged, data live).
- CRUD: "+ New Narcotic" + per-drug Edit modal (fields + precursor rows + hotspot
  rows with density + case link); children replaced on save; delete gated to
  Director/Command. Empty/sign-in states; realtime; recompute guards zero precursors.
- Places' production-recipe + drug picker read the DRUGS cache (Places remains
  localStorage for now; links by name).
- Verified: node --check; clean jsdom load (sign-in notice, no errors); live MCP
  round-trip on `cid` (narcotic→precursor→hotspot insert; cascade-clean delete).
